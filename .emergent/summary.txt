The trajectory details the deployment of a full-stack Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) application from a user-provided GitHub repository onto the Emergent platform. The process began with cloning the repository, which initially failed due to the directory not being empty and the repository being private. Once cloned, the AI engineer proceeded to set up the backend and frontend environments.

Significant challenges arose during the setup. The AI encountered numerous port conflicts, forcing it to manually run services on non-standard ports before correcting them to align with Emergent's requirements (backend on 8000, frontend on 3000). The  service manager consistently failed to start the services correctly, leading the AI to run them manually for most of the session.

After successfully running the services manually and verifying the core save-list-approve workflow, the user requested the integration of AI features. The AI enabled this by setting the .

The most substantial part of the work involved troubleshooting why the application was not visible in Emergent's Preview feature, which repeatedly showed a blank screen. This debugging process involved fixing deployment blockers identified by a deployment agent (removing a PyTorch dependency, correcting the backend port in the Dockerfile) and culminated in identifying a network configuration mismatch. The root cause was the frontend's  file pointing to , which is inaccessible from the preview's external network context. The final action was changing this URL to use  to resolve the issue.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to deploy the user's existing full-stack Digital Marketing Manager (DMM) application from a GitHub repository onto the Emergent platform. The application is a sophisticated marketing tool with a long-term vision that includes AI-driven strategy generation, automated content creation (via platforms like Canva), virtual influencer management, and deep analytics.

**Initial MVP & Deployment:**
The current version of the app functions as an MVP, allowing for manual creation and approval of marketing strategies. The deployment requirements are specific:
- **Repo:** 
- **Backend:** Located in the  subfolder, running on port 8000 with a health check at .
- **Frontend:** A React+Vite app in the  subfolder, running on port 80 (internally 3000).
- **Routing:**  routes to the backend, and  routes to the frontend, with TLS enabled.

**Feature Enhancement (Phase 1):**
After deployment, the next phase is to begin realizing the user's broader vision. The first step, which has been initiated, is to enable the dormant AI strategy generation feature by configuring the . The next agreed-upon step is to integrate the Canva API for automated visual content creation based on these strategies.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Application:** FastAPI (Python) backend and React (Vite) frontend.
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas for data persistence.
- **Containerization:** Dockerfiles are provided for both frontend and backend services.
- **Process Management:**  is used to manage background services, although it proved problematic and was often bypassed.
- **Deployment Environment:** Emergent platform with specific constraints, including port expectations (8000 for backend) and a sandboxed Preview feature.
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes an  to enable GPT-5 powered features.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with separate directories for the frontend and backend services.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Modifications:**

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file, containing all API endpoints for strategy creation, listing, approval, and AI generation.
  - **Changes:** The port binding was edited multiple times to troubleshoot conflicts and finally set to  to align with Emergent's deployment requirements. A temporary debug endpoint () was added to verify environment variable loading.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies for the backend.
  - **Changes:** The  dependency was identified as a deployment blocker and was removed from this file to ensure compatibility with the deployment environment.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Contains environment variables for the backend, including database connection strings and API keys.
  - **Changes:** This file was created from scratch. The , , and  were added as per the user's request. Later, the  was added to enable AI features.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The React component responsible for displaying the list of strategies pending approval.
  - **Changes:** This file was edited to fix a bug where strategies were not appearing. The fix involved modifying the  function to correctly display item details by checking for both  and , and also adding the .

- ****
  - **Importance:** Contains environment variables for the frontend, primarily the backend URL.
  - **Changes:** This file was created and modified multiple times. The  was initially set to , then updated to . The final and most critical change was updating it to  to fix the blank preview screen by allowing the preview environment to access the backend service.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Configuration file for the Vite build tool.
  - **Changes:** This file was created because it was missing, which caused an initial failure when trying to run the frontend development server. A basic configuration was added.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Canva Integration:** Implement the Canva API to automatically generate visual content based on the marketing strategies created in the app. This is the immediate next development task for Phase 1.
- **Further AI Integrations:** Integrate other specified platforms like SuperAGI, Influencer AI, and Metricool in subsequent phases to fully realize the user's product vision.
- **Full Product Vision:** Long-term development to build out advanced features like automated posting, AI-generated influencers, and deep cross-platform analytics.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the core focus was resolving a persistent and critical issue where the user could not see the application in Emergent's Preview feature, which consistently displayed a blank screen. After numerous failed troubleshooting attempts—including fixing deployment blockers, managing port conflicts, and restarting services—the root cause was identified by a  as a network configuration mismatch.

The problem was that the frontend's  file defined  as . The  address is only accessible from within the same container, but Emergent's preview system operates from an external network context and could not resolve it.

The final action taken was to edit  and change the URL to . This change binds the service to all available network interfaces, making it accessible from outside the container. Both the backend and frontend services were then verified to be running on their correct ports (8000 and 3000, respectively) with this new configuration in place, awaiting user confirmation that the preview is now working.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user to test the Preview button again to confirm that changing the backend URL to  has resolved the blank screen issue.
